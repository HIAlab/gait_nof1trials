This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
# following tuturial at: http://www.jkarreth.net/files/bayes-cph_Tutorial-JAGS.pdf
library(R2jags)
# An example model file is given in:
model.file <- system.file(package = "R2jags", "model", "schools.txt") 
# data
J <- 8.0
y <- c(28.4,7.9,-2.8,6.8,-0.6,0.6,18.0,12.2)
sd <- c(14.9,10.2,16.3,11.0,9.4,11.4,10.4,17.6) 
jags.data <- list("y","sd","J")
jags.params <- c("mu","sigma","theta")
jags.inits <- function(){  
  list("mu"=rnorm(1),"sigma"=runif(1),"theta"=rnorm(J))
}
jagsfit <- jags(data=list("y","sd","J"), inits = jags.inits, jags.params, n.iter = 10, model.file = model.file)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
